# MiSTeryNano board

The MiSTeryNano can be used with off-the-shelf components and
some breadboard setup.

To simplify this the MiSTeryNano project provides additional
hardware:

  - The [MiSTeryShield20k](misteryshield20k) provides a base board for
  the Tang Nano 20k and the M0S Dock with a DB9 joystick connector and
  MIDI ports

  - The [M0S PMOD](m0s_pmod) allows to use the M0S Dock on a PMOD
  port as e.g. available on the Tang Primer 25K or the Tang Mega 138K

  - The [Keyboard](keyboard) design is a tiny 50% Atari ST style keyboard which is meant to become the basis for a Mini Atari ST
