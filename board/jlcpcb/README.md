# JLCPCB production data for MiSTeryNano MIDI shield

These files can be uploaded to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) in order
to have this board produced through their PCBA service (fully
assembled and ready to run).

JLCPCB does not have 3D models for all components and J6, J7 and U1
are only rendered as small blocks in their production preview:

The produced devices will still be complete with all components being
properly mounted.
