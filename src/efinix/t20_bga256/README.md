# MiSTeryNix, MiSTery for Efinix T20

This is a very early port of MiSTeryNano to the Efinix T20BGA256
development board.

## Additional Hardware

It expects some additional hardware to be connected to the ```BANK1B_1C```
connector:

A HDMI connector using 100nF series capacitors in series with each TMDS line.
Some screens also need 5V to be supplied. It's thus preferred to use a common
HDMI PMOD.

| Signal  | Pin  |
|---|---|
| TMDS_CLOCK_P  | GPIOL_11 |
| TMDS_CLOCK_N  | GPIOL_12 |
| TMDS_DATA_0_P | GPIOL_13 |
| TMDS_DATA_0_N | GPIOL_14 |
| TMDS_DATA_1_P | GPIOL_15 |
| TMDS_DATA_1_N | GPIOL_16 |
| TMDS_DATA_2_P | GPIOL_17 |
| TMDS_DATA_2_P | GPIOL_18 |

A SD/TF card slot needs to be connected to using six 33 ohms series resistors
for the data, command and clock lines.

| Signal  | Pin  |
|---|---|
| SD_DAT[0] | GPIOL_22 |
| SD_DAT[1] | GPIOL_21 |
| SD_DAT[2] | GPIOL_26 |
| SD_DAT[3] | GPIOL_25 |
| SD_CMD | GPIOL_24 |
| SD_CLK | GPIOL_23 |

And finally a [FPGA Companion](https://github.com/harbaum/FPGA-Companion/) is needed for USB and general system control via SPI.

| Signal  | Pin  |
|---|---|
| SPI_CLK | GPIOL_29 |
| SPI_MOSI | GPIOL_30 |
| SPI_MISO | GPIOL_27 |
| SPI_CS | GPIOL_28 |
| SD_INT | GPIOL_31 |

## Limitations

The T20 is used to 95% by this and to achieve this a few limitations
had to be implemented.

  - The Atari ST Blitter is permanenlty disabled
  - The Atari STE extensions are permanenlty disabled
  - ACSI harddisk support is permanenlty disabled
  - Builds are unstable and you might need to play with the ```seed``` value to get a stable result
  - HDMI is generated by pure logic and without dedicated LVDS shifters or the like and the signal may not be accepted by all displays
  - Currently SD card writing does not work. Neither settings can thus be saved from the OSD menu nor can the Atari ST write to floppy disk. This may eventually be fixed.
